## How

** update docs/component.puml with project components, create a .png, and link it here ***

### For Development
#### Setup

- cd to project directory
- `go get ./...`


#### Testing



#### Before you do a PR




### For Production

The Makefile contains commands that can be run by Jenkins. Do not put developer commands in the Makefile. If you
need developer tool commands, create a package.json file, if not already done, and add your commands to that. Then run them
via npm.
